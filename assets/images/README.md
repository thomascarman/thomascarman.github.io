# Logo Setup Instructions

To add your logo from tcarman.com to this site:

1. Place your logo file in this directory (e.g., `logo.png`, `logo.svg`, etc.)
2. Update the `_config.yml` file to add the logo path:

```yaml
logo: /assets/images/logo.png
```

The logo will automatically appear in the header of all pages once configured.
